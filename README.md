# PyRosetta Interactive Labs

**Note: The notebooks in this repository are a work in progress!**

This repository containts Interactive Jupyter notebooks to demonstrate essential protein design concepts using PyRosetta and PyMOL. A basic knowledge of proteins is assumed.

These notebooks are being developed by James Lucas for UC Berkeley BIOENG C219 Protein Engineering. 

## Installation Instructions.

You will need three things to use these notebooks:
1. [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. [PyRosetta](http://www.pyrosetta.org/dow)
3. [PyMOL](https://pymol.org/2/)

### Super Simple Installation:

The easiest way to use these notebooks is to install the [Python 3.7 Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). 
Anaconda already contains most of the dependencies that these notebooks require. Anaconda also installs the Conda package manager which you can use to easily install PyRosettta ([instructions here](http://www.pyrosetta.org/dow) under "RosettaCommons Conda Channel").

### Installation without Anaconda:

Assuming you already have Python3, you can use the requirements.txt in this repository and pip3 to install the notebook dependencies. To install PyRosetta, download the appropriate release from the [PyRosetta download page](http://www.pyrosetta.org/dow) and follow the instructions there.

### PyMOL

You can download educaitonal-use PyMOL [here](https://pymol.org/edu/?q=educational/).

## Usage.

Navigate to this repository on your computer and run `jupyter notebook` from the command line. This will open a dashboard in your default browser where you can select and run the notebooks.
