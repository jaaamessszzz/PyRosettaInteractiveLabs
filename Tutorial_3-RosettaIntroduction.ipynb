The residue is the individual unit of a Pose, where each residue stores the degrees of freedom within ($\\chi$ angles) and between ($\\phi$,$\\psi$,$\\omega$) residues. It is important to note that Rosetta internally represents proteins using torsion angles since many modeling and design algorithms depend on manipulating these DOFs. The Pose is reponsible for converting these torsion angles into the xyz coordinates that we are familiar with.

    "## Energy Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In computational modeling of proteins, an energy function (aka score function, force field) is used to evaluate the potential energy of a particular conformation. For most protein engineering applications, the goal is to minimize the potential energy of a protein sequence/conformation while fulfilling design constraints (e.g. adopting a particular structure, creating a protein-protein interface).\n",
    "\n",
    "A comprehensive treatment of the Rosetta energy function is outlined in [this paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00125). It is *highly recommended* that you at least read through the introduction of this paper. We will unpack the highlights of the paper in this tutorial. In short, Rosetta's energy function is composed of indiviual terms that are evaluated for a particular residue (one-body term) or between residue pairs (two-body term). Weights are applied to each of these terms and summed for all residues and residue pairs to evaluate a total energy for a protein conformation. These weights are found through a process called parameterization, where the weights (adjustable parameters of the energy function) are adjusted in an iterative manner to find values that best balance contributions from individual score terms to recapitulate observed macromolecular structural data. This typcially means that the energy function evaluates a \"real\" structure as lower in energy compared to \"decoy\" structures. The process Rosetta uses to parameterize its energy function is outlined [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515585/).\n",
    "\n",
    "While many components of Rosetta's energy function use traditional units (e.g. kcal/mol), statistical terms and parameterization of Rosetta energy function results in Rosetta calculating energies with arbirary units (colloquially referred to as Rosetta Energy Units, REU). Being said, the latest iteration of Rosetta's energy function (REF2015) has been parameterized to better approximate units of kcal/mol.\n",
    "\n",
    "The components to Rosetta's energy function are composed of physical terms you should already be familiar with (Lennard-Jones potential, Coulomb's law) as well as statistical terms that describe observed distubutions in protein structures (rotamer propensity, hydrogen bond geometries, Ramachandran space)."

Refer to [Alford et al.](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00125) for more in-depth discussion of each of these terms, plus additional terms not covered here.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Van der Waals and Electrostatics\n",

Note that the functions that Rosetta evaluates for these terms (blue) differs from the functions that you may be familiar with from your chemistry/physics courses (red). This is done for several reasons:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. To allow different weightings of individual terms during modeling/design protocols. For instance, several commonly used Rosetta design protocols ramp fa_rep while keeping fa_atr constant to \"relax\" structures.\n",
    "2. To apply heuristics that better reflect modeling of biological molecules.\n",
    "3. To allow for easier/faster evaluation of energy terms. The functional forms of many score terms are altered to removed difficult-to-evaluate gradients or impossible-to-evaluate discontinuities.\n",

    "* **hbond_sc and hbond_bb_sc:** Evaluates the energy of side-chain-side-chain and backbone-side-chain hydrogen bonds, respectively. While the fa_elec term partially contributes to hydrogen bonds, hbond_sc and hbond_bb_sc specifically evaluates energies based on the observed hydrogen bonding geometries from high-resolution crystal structures. A hydrogen bond is composed of a donor atom, the donor atom's hydrogen, the hydrogen bond acceptor atom, and the acceptor atom base (Panel A). The hydridization of the acceptor atom affects the distribution of favorable hydrogen bond geometries depending on whether it is *sp$_2$*(Panel B) or *sp$\\_3$* hybridized.\n",

    "* **fa_sol and lk_ball_wtd:** This pair of score terms evaluates the isotropic and anisotropic energy of desolvation between pairs of residues. You may have noticed that the structures we pass from Rosetta to PyMol do not include any waters. Instead of explicitly modeling waters in and around protein structures (as in an explicit solvation model), Rosetta opts for an implicit solvation model where the energetic contributions of water are approximated. Rosetta uses an implicit solvation model, specifically the [Lazaridis-Karplus Gaussian Exclusion Model](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10753811), because explicitly modleing waters is computationally expensive and slow. For a pair of residues, this model calcualtes the energy that is required for atoms in residue A to desolvate atoms in residue B and visa-versa. Solvation in Rosetta is separated into fa_sol (panel A), an isotropic term that assumes water is evenly distributed around an atom, and lk_ball_wtd (panel B), an anisotropic term that accounts for ordered waters that may form hydrogen bonds with polar atoms. \n",

This probability is affected by whether a proline is present (Panel B) or is not present (Panel C) at the next position in the protein sequence.\n",

This is intentional: most score terms in Rosetta's energy function are only evaluated out to 6$\\unicode{x212B}$ since interactions past that are assumed to be negligible. There is also a practical reason for this: as we alter conformations in the Pose (e.g. make a mutation, adjust a secondary structure element), we only need to recalulate energies in the interaction graph within 6$\\unicode{x212B}$ of the change. This lets us keep previously calculated energies and reduces the number of energies we need to update. This is extremely important for design tasks, where a protocol might be making millions of small changes to a Pose!\n",

Simulated annealing proceeds one step at a time, where each step selects a random position, samples a rotamer from that position's RotamerSet, and evaluates whether the change should be kept in the context of the entire protein. The goal of simulated annealing is to find a rotamer combinations that yield low-energy solutions.

    "The Packer allows us to find low-energy conformations in sequence space by subsituting side-chain rotamers on a fixed-backbone structure. These conformations are made up of discrete rotamers and a fixed backbone; we sacrifice accurate representation of conformational space in exchange for sampling efficiency. We can apply minimization to find the *local minimum* of our energy function for a given conformation by making small adjustments to all degrees of freedom in a the Pose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimization, or gradient descent, works by evaulating the gradient of the energy function with respect to the degrees of freedom (we will be looking at torsional DOFs here) in the backbone and side-chains of the protein. An important property of Rosetta's energy function is that we can take the derivative of each score term to evaluate the gradient of the full energy function. The gradient tells us which direction we should move (i.e. how to adjust each degree of freedom) to minimize the value of the overall energy function. By iteratively evaluating the gradient and making small moves in the direction of the gradient, we will converge on the local energy minima for the current conformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This video by [3Blue1Brown on YouTube](https://youtu.be/IHZwWFHWa-w?t=351) provides an excellent visual explanation behind the gradient decent algorithm (watch 5:51 - 8:34). In the context of the video, our cost funciton is the energy function and our input space is the current conformation of the pose.\n",
