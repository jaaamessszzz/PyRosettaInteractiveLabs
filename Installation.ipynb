    "# Installation\n",
    "This document will guide you through setting up the Python3 Anaconda Distribution on your computer. A terminal will be required, but all necessary commands will be spelled out here. Anytime this guide asks you to type something in the command line, remember to press Enter!\n",
    "\n",
    "## MacOS and Linux\n",
    "### Anaconda\n",
    "The [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) is a streamlined method of installing Python3 and commonly used scientific packages on your computer. In addition, Anaconda includes a package manager called conda that we will use to streamline installation of other software we will need to manipulate and visualize proteins.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Follow this link](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) to download Anaconda for the latest version of Python3 (Python3.7 at the time of writing). It is recommended that you use the 64-bit graphical installer.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Assets/Installation/AnacondaMacOSDownload.png\" width=\"800\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the installer after it is completed downloading and follow the prompts. We will be using the default installation settings for Anaconda, so you will not need to modify anything. When the installation is complete, Anaconda will be installed in the home directory of you computer (type `echo ~/` in a terminal to see the path of your home directory). On MacOS, this should resemble `/Users/<your_username>` and on Linux it should resemble `/home/<your_username>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it! To check that Anaconda was successfully installed, open a terminal and type `python3`. You should see something like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Assets/Installation/AnacondaPython3Terminal.png\" width=\"600\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### PyRosetta\n",
    "[PyRosetta](http://www.pyrosetta.org/) is the Python interface to the Rosetta MacroMolecular Modeling Suite. This is the python package we will primarily be using to handle and manipulate proteins.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use PyRosetta, we will first need to obtain a license. Go to the [University of Washington CoMotion site](https://els.comotion.uw.edu/express_license_technologies/pyrosetta) to obtain an Academic PyRosetta license. After submitting your information, you will recieve an email with a `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` that we will use to download PyRosetta.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the conda package manager that comes with Anaconda to install PyRosetta (type `conda` into the command line to check that conda is installed, you should see a list of usage and arguments). As a package manager, we can use conda to download and install packages using the `install` argument. However, by default conda only knows to look for packages in certain places: we will need to tell conda where to look to download and install PyRosetta. Conda uses a file called `.condarc` to see which locations it should check to download and install a package. `.condarc` exists in your home directory (type `echo ~/` in a terminal to see the path of your home directory). To edit your `.condarc` file, you may use a command line editor such as vim, emacs, or nano. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using nano, type `nano ~/.condarc` into the command line. This will open your `.condarc` file so you may edit it. Under `channels:`, add the line `- https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@conda.graylab.jhu.edu` so that your `.condarc` looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "channels:\n",
    "  - https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@conda.graylab.jhu.edu\n",
    "  - defaults\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Pres `crtl + O` to save your changes and `ctrl + X` to exit the editor. In the command line, type `source ~/.condarc`  to load our new settings. Now we can use the `conda install pyrosetta` command to install PyRosetta automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more advanced users, you may follow the instructions on the [PyRosetta download page](http://www.pyrosetta.org/dow) to pull PyRosetta from GitHub or download PyRosetta releases as a tar ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PyMOL\n",
    "[PyMOL](https://pymol.org/2/) is a molecular visualization package that we will be using to visualize proteins from the [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/) or generate in PyRosetta. Like PyRosetta, we will need to obtain a license before we install PyMOL with conda.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Follow this link](https://pymol.org/edu/?q=educational/) to obtain an educational PyMOL license. After submitting your information, you will recieve an email where you will download a `pymol-license.lic` file. Remeber where you save this file!\n",
    "\n",
    "To install PyMOL (we will be specifically install PyMOL2), use the command `conda install -c schrodinger pymol`. This will automatically install PyMOL on your computer. To use PyMOL, either click the new PyMOL link that was created in your applications directory or use the command `pymol` in the command line. \n",
    "\n",
    "To activate PyMOL, go to the command bar and click `Help > Install New License File`. This will ask for your `pymol-license.lic` file that you downloaded earlier. Select it and you PyMOL will be activated and ready to use!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be making one small edit to streamline interfacing PyMOL with PyRosetta. In order for PyMOL to visualize proteins created by PyRosetta, we need to establish a connection between PyRosetta and PyMOL every time we open PyMOL. Instead of doing this manually, we can edit a settings file so that this is done automatically every time PyMOL is started.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open PyMOL and click on `File > Edit pymolrc` from the command bar. This opens the `.pymolrc` settings file for PyMOL where we can issue a set of commands every time PyMOL is initialized. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type the following command into your `.pymolrc`, replacing `{X}` with the Python version that Anaconda installed (this should be `3.7`):\n",
    "\n",
    "`run ~/anaconda3/lib/python{X}/site-packages/pyrosetta/PyMOL-RosettaServer.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Save and close `.pymolrc`. Everytime PyMOL is opened, PyMOL will automatically run this command so PyMOL knows to look for protein structures from PyRosetta.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're all set up!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Downloading and Running Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "[Follow this link](https://github.com/jaaamessszzz/PyRosettaInteractiveLabs) to go to the GitHub repository for the Interactive labs. If you have `git` installed, you can simply `git clone git@github.com:jaaamessszzz/PyRosettaInteractiveLabs.git`. Otherwise, download the repository as a ZIP file and unpack it in a convenient location on your computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where you unpacked the interactive labs. Type `jupyter notebook` in the command line. This should open a new page in your default browser where you will see the files in your directory. Click on any of the  \n",
