    "\n",
    "Enzymes are special proteins that possess the ability to catalyze chemical reactions and transform substrates/reactants into products. We will take a cursory look at the reaction catalyzed by [carbonic anhydrase](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/49), an important enzyme that helps solublize carbon dioxide in our blood by converting carbon dioxide and water into carbonic acid. To catalyze this reaction, carbonic anhydrase possesses a pocket, called the active site, that can transiently bind the substrate. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Assets/Tutorial_4/CA_full.png\" width=\"600\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The active site contains a set of amino acid residues, and sometimes a [cofactor/prothetic group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cofactor_(biochemistry)), in a specific configuration that permits chemistry to occur (e.g. acid-base catalysis, metal-ion catalysis). Carbonic anhydrase has three histidine residues coordinating a zinc ion (large purple/grey sphere). This zinc ion coordinates a hydroxide ion (red sphere) that is primed for nucleophilic attack of carbon dioxide bound in the active site.\n",

    "The hump between reactants and products in the reaction coordinate is the **activation energy**; this is the minimum amount of energy required for the reaction to proceed forward. The peak of the reaction coordinate is where the **transistion state** is formed; the transition state is a transient high-energy strained state where bonds are being formed/broken to interconvert between substrates and products.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is here where enzymes act: enzymes increase the rate of reaction by stabilizing the transition state and lowering the activation energy for the reaction. Note in the the reaction coordinate above that the activation energy for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction (blue path) has a significantly lower activation energy that the uncatalyzed reaction (red path). \n",

    "where $k$ is the reaction rate, $-E_a$ is the activation energy, $R$ is gas constant, and $T$ is temperature. $A$ is a parameter called the pre-exponential factor that is emperically determined and relates temperature to the reaction rate. Using this equation, it is straightforward to see how lowering the activation energy of a reaction will lead to an increase in reaction rate.\n",

    "A [theozyme](http://blueline.ucdavis.edu/2ndTier/3rdTier/Theozymes.html) (**theo**retical en**zyme**) is a computationally-determined configuration of functional groups predicted to stabilize a given transition state. While theozymes were [originally proposed](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1367593198801129) for elucidating the functional contributions of active site residues toward catalysis in enzymes, theozymes have been adopted for forward design of new protein function. [This review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0958166914000652) covers the success of *de novo* designed enzymes for the [diels-alder](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/329/5989/309), [retro-aldol](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/319/5868/1387), and [kemp elimination](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18354394) reactions. These successses all use theozymes determined by quantum mechanical calculations to build a functional active site into an existing protein structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will be using a theozyme derived from PDB ID [2JIE](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2JIE). 2JIE is a crystal structure of a beta-glucosidase from *Bacillus polymyxa* bound to the transition state inhibitor 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-alpha-D-glucopyranose. Beta-glucosidases catalyze the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds. Since a transition state inhibitor resembles the transition state of the reaction that this enzyme catalyzes, we can infer the contact geometries of the catalytic residues with the transition state for a new substrate, in this case 4-para-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG), by observing the protein's interactions with the inhibitor.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's load 2JIE into PyMOL and investigate how the catalytic residues interact with the transition state inhibitor. We will be creating our theozyme using the relative positions of each catalytic residue with the transition state inhibitor.\n",

RosettaMatch simultaneously checks that catalytic residues can be built in this pocket that satisfy the interaction geometries defined in a constraints file.\n",

These six values (three Euclidian, three Euler) are binned into discrete values in 6D space, where the position and rotamer that resulted in this configuration are stored.
